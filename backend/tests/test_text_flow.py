AITA for telling my 17M brother he's being ridiculous?

So basically I'm 25F and my BF is 28M. We've been together for 3 years.
My brother won't stop complaining about my SO. TBH it's getting annoying.

He's like "you shouldn't've moved in together" and "I can't believe you did that".
IMO he's just jealous. BTW, I didn't ask for his opinion anyway.

**UPDATE**: He apologized! We're good now.

Edit: Thanks for all the support!
TL;DR: Brother was being annoying, now we're cool.
