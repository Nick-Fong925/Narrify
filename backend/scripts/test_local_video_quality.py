AITA for refusing to attend my sister's wedding after she uninvited my husband?

So this whole situation started three months ago when my sister got engaged. 
I was thrilled for her and immediately assumed my husband would be invited since we've been married for five years.

Last week, she called me and dropped a bomb. She said that to "keep the peace" with our conservative grandmother, 
she's decided to make it a "no plus ones" wedding for cousins. The thing is, my husband isn't a plus one, he's my spouse.

I told her this was ridiculous and that I wouldn't come without him. She got defensive and said I was being selfish 
and making her wedding about me. But here's the kicker - her fianc√©'s siblings are all bringing their spouses.

When I pointed this out, she said that's different because they're "his family." I'm so hurt and confused. 
My husband has been nothing but kind to everyone in our family.

So I told her if he's not invited, I won't be there either. Now my whole family is calling me dramatic 
and saying I'm ruining her special day. Am I the asshole here?
