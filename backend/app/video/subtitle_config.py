Subtitle configuration for video generation

IMPORTANT: Video Quality Notes
- Current base video resolution: 2560x1440 @ 60fps (2K horizontal, auto-cropped to 810x1440 vertical)
- Auto-crop system: Horizontal videos are automatically center-cropped to 9:16 aspect ratio
- Final output: ~810x1440 (HD quality, between 720p and 1080p)
- This resolution is EXCELLENT for YouTube Shorts - much better than old 480x854
